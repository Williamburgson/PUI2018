### Assignment 1:
In assignment 1, I plotted different distributions and the distribution of their sample means. The sample mean of each distribution approaches the population mean as the sample size increases. The distribution of the sample means shows a bell shaped curve which means that they are in the form of normal distribution. 

### Assignment 2:
Collaborator: Alice NetID: ql459

- Alice collected and prepared the data

- I created the hypothesis and plotted the data

I think that the older riders tend to ride the citibike for a shorter duration. So I proposed the null hypothesis as the opposite, which is that the older riders ride as long or longer than the younger riders. And I decided that an older rider should be born before or in the year of 1960

### Assignment 3:
Collaborator: Alice NetID: ql459

- I proposed hypothesis

- Alice perform the Z test and analized the result

The Z test shows how many standard deviations away we are, and if the result is larger than our predefined value, which in this case is two standar deviations, we can reject the null hypothesis
